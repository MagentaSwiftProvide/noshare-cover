//! noshare-cover: Rust core of a Hyprland plugin.
//!
//! Hyprland offers plugins no C API, only its own C++ ABI, which is built for a
//! specific compositor version. So all the logic lives here (media, decoding,
//! playback clock, config, resource lifecycle, extra rects), and the thin shim
//! `shim/plugin.cpp` only registers the hook, reads the config and window
//! rules, turns decoded frames into Hyprland textures and draws them.
//!
//! The boundary between them is the C ABI from [`ffi`], declared in `include/noshare_cover.h`.
